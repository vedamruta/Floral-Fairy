# Floral-Fairy

Flowers are one of the most beautiful creations of Mother Earth. I adore them for many reasons like: it's geometry, colour and fragrance. Observing nature is my favourite hobby especially watching bees and butterflies doing their job of collecting nectors of vibrant flowers. I also have a collection of leaves that I have came across in my nearby places.

I have completed learning the basics and intermediate of HTML and CSS and wanted to get hands on practice in designing web pages and building them and this is one of them.

This website provides information about Flora in India and a few good to keep Indoor Plants covering basic good first information.

Hope you enjoy visiting this :)
